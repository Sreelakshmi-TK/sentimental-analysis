# sentimental-analysis
This Python script trains and compares three recurrent neural networks SimpleRNN, LSTM, and GRU on the IMDB movie review sentiment dataset. It preprocesses text data, builds each model with embedding layers, trains for 10 epochs, evaluates accuracy and loss, and visualizes performance through training curves for all models.
